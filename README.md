# ball_balancer
Repository containing all code for the ball balancer



## Todo

### C++ Camera 
- [ ] Make resolution and other camera parameters part of a config.
- [ ] Make resolution of the calibration scale to target resolution.
- [ ] 

### Ball tracking
- [ ] Improve tracking; for instance keeping track of ball and predicting/verifying next location. 
- [ ] 

### Motor control with Teensy
- [ ] First be able to control angle of 1 stepper with Teensy
- [ ] Control all 3 steppers simultaneously

### Communication with Teensy
- [ ] Code should be written for serial communication with Teensy. 

### Modelling
- [ ] Design hinging legs for motor -> plate
- [ ] Write out kinematics for the plate so we obtain function that takes desired z-level and orientation for the plate and outputs motor angles
- [ ]
